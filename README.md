# Mind's Stake 

>Mind's Stake is a game made in Unity and is inspired by the games Fear & Hunger, The Binding of Isaac, Undertale and Deepwoken.

>The goal of this project is to make immersive environment. Player should be hit by the all consuming stress from the dark and mysterious dungeon. Player can also suffer from variety of mental illnesses and phobias.

>There are many monsters crawling through the dungeon and each of them represent some kind of phobia. Staying around these monsters makes the player more and more stressed, which can make the combat even more difficult. It's also worth mentioning that the combat is turned based with some quick-time events.
## Future of the project
>I need to implement items. Items that could help player in combat or learn some lore about the game.

>Next I need to focus on creating procedural generation for the dungeon, so each experience could be unique
