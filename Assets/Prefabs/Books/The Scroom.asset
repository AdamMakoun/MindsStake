  text: "The scroom is a dangerous fungoid.\nThey are dangerous because of their
    speed.\nOtherwise it shouldn't be a problem to deal\nwith those vermin. If they
    get remotely close\nto source of heat they will get burnt.\nIf you don't have
    any source of heat, \nYou can slice off their legs.\nWithout their legs they
    are good as dead."
